But, eventually every player will choose a Guild of their liking and hopefully stay there for a while. A guild that matches their playing style, and that they feel has friendly members that will help them grow their city.\n\nSome Guilds have requirements, such as completing level 1 in GE; fighting a minimum amount in GBG; owning certain Great Buildings (GB) at a certain level; minimum donations to new GBs in the Sticks to Bricks channel; logging in a certain number of times per week or even day; etc. These types of Guilds typically do very well in helping advance your city, with the understanding that you will give back to your Guild as well.",

        "Text": "<b>How to Grow Your City by Growing Your Guild</b>\n\n[image]One of the easiest ways to generate Forge Points as well as buildings that create FP and fighting boosts (and also goods for your guild) is by fighting or negotiating in Guild Battlegrounds.\n\nAnd the cheapest way of getting those FP and buildings is for your guild leaders to put down as many siege camps as possible on the GBG map. Unfortunately, siege camps are paid for through the guild Treasury, which consists solely of goods that guild members put into it.\n\nTurns out the easiest way to consistently build the guild treasury is to have an Observatory and an Arc (and the Statue of Honor or Great Elephant you can win in GBG, and a few more Event buildings) built in your city. When you collect from these buildings they automatically deposit goods into the treasury for you. The higher they are, the more they give. Some guilds require you to have both Arc/Obs in the ground and at least at level 10.\n\nHaving these GBs creates a sort of “circle of life” flow of resources where your investment in the treasury allows the guild to buy siege camps in GBG, which dramatically reduces the cost of fighting or negotiating to you, which allows you to play GBG longer, which allows you to to win more rewards, such as Forge Points and awesome buildings like Statues of Honor and Royal Elephant. It is very possible to win hundreds of FP in one session when there are a lot of siege camps installed and your troops have good fighting bonuses, which can help you invest and quickly grow your city. But each camp costs the Guild some goods, which can only come from you.\n\nSo, in a way, it’s actually a <strong>selfish</strong> thing to install both an Observatory and an Arc. You’re not doing it for the guild. No, no, no. You’re doing it for you. Think of it like paying for the motor oil which you will put in your motor. It just runs better.\n\nSo, build and level both an Observatory and an Arc, and plant and keep leveling any GBG-building, like the Statue of Honor or Great Elephant. You’ll be glad you did, and so will everyone else.",

And so, being able to \"pay back\" or help keep the Guild Treasury well stocked is very important.\n\nEither make frequent donations to the Treasury, manually, or plant Buildings that automatically create and pay Goods to the Treasury for you. These buildings include GBs the Arc, and the Observatory, as well as the GBG Special Buildings Statue of Honor and the Great Elephant, and the Egypt settlement's Special Building Royal Bathhouse, and Viking settlement's Timeless Dojo, as well as certain settlement Emmisaries.\n\nHaving these buildings in your city, maximized in levels, will go a long way towards making you an important member of your Guild, as well as ensure its health and competitiveness.",

That is why you joined the guild, is it not?  To enjoy the benefits?  Ten goods per day sounds like reasonable terms of support, once you get your city going.  THEN if you want to contribute goods to the Treasury from lower eras, have at it!  You'll find the amount needed to support your current age/era will gradually increase until in the Space Ages you'll be contributing 385/week.

In this age you can easily fight GE and GBG and get some Great Buildings in the ground.\n\nGoing forward, whenever you advance to the next age (aging-up) you should make sure you have enough FP in the bank, and all the coins and supplies required to get through the Research Tree quickly. You can determine what it will cost in the table, below.\n\nWhat most players do, once they've decided to camp out in a particular age is sit at the very end of the Research Tree, not opening even the first item in the next age, and slowly amass the resources to be able to run through the research items in one shot, then go back to the city, rip out all the troop camps and replace them with the new ones of your new Age, and start building up your units.",

This small 3x3 building does not cost much to raise, and as it gets leveled higher and higher, it provides more and more Goods for the Guild. Many guilds out there make this GB a requirement to ensure the Treasury is never empty.\n\nWe are pushing for low-age members to have an Observatory to keep our treasury running, if they don’t already have a building that automatically donates to the guild treasury (Obs, Arc, SoH, Elephant, etc). The Obs is easy GB to get goods for, but prints are always hard to find.",

In fact, the true sign that you are ready to age-up is if you can successfully auto-battle your way through all four levels of GE.\n\nWhen to Auto-Battle? If you see that your army is way over-powered for the units you need to fight, then autobattle. It's quicker and you probably won't lose any units.\n\nSome Fighting Tips: If the opposing army has no artillary, such as Catapult, Trebuchet, Cannons, etc., and no Mounted Archers, or basically no units that can attack from afar, then you can just skip your first turn or two and let them come to you. \"Wait 'till you see the whites of their eyes\", and all that. You will be able to attack them once they are nearer.  If the opposing army has artillary or any other shoot-from-distance units, you need to run like hell across the field of battle to get to them before they pick off all your units. Leave a few units in the middle of the field, while sending the majority of them after the artilary.\n\nFighting Boosts: If you are in the upper levels of GE or attrition has gotten high in GBG, you can go to the Tavern shop and buy some bonus attack, or your inventory to see if you have any fighting boosts there.",

For instance, if you have three Heavy Infantry and five Rogues (Mik's favorite combination for tough battles) if one of your Rogues gets hit, it will sustain no damage, and instead turn into a Heavy Infantry unit, since that's all that's on the field that it could turn into. It then acts exactly like a normal Heavy Infantry unit. If there is nothing left but Rogues, it will likely die, since it cannot turn into anything else, and Rogues have no defense. Thus, going into battle with only Rogues dooms them all. Going into battle with seven Rogues is also risky in that you need to protect the one non-Rogue unit from dying.",

SoL has small swaps 5, 8, 10, 20 that allow you to place FPs on someone else's GB. Larger swaps of 30, 50, and 100 for those who have larger amounts are also available.\n\nWhen using the Swap threads, your GB is getting boosted and you are helping another Guild Member to get the next level, while providing you the opportunity to get back some of your FPs, plus medals when your fellow Guild Members GB levels, if you swap enough to secure a position (P1,2,3,4,5). Here is a FoE guide for [link:Swap Threads Etiquette], that gives you insight into why they are popular, usage, tips, etc.\n\nWith our Guild, the way you post to a Swap Thread is pretty simple. To secure your spot you post the GB you want someone to add FPs to, then you add the appropriate fps on the GB that is posted before yours.  A simple tip for newer members, target GBs at lower levels, you have a better chance at getting a reward position.\n\nThat being said, the main reason for swaps is to move your GBs and have an opportunity at additions rewards. As a caution, never over-swap, only put in the required amount. Overswapping is not permitted.\n\nLastly, we are encouraging all players at any age to learn the 1.9 strategy, and for senior players to minimize the use of swap channels. While this is an easy way to invest and be invested in, it is not as efficient as the 1.9 thread, where you invest FPs based on the number of FP you will win for achieving one of the five investment Positions.

Most of them came from the hourly dispensation. Your best bet was to post your favorite building to the 5 FP thread so you had a chance of getting BP off someone else’s building while you spent your 10-hour allowance to clear the bin for more free FP. These were lean times.  Your army sucked. Your GB sucked. You had no supplies and dammit you had no coins coming in. I remember an elder once saying never post FP to your own building. Always post to some else’s in the swap threads because someone would post back to yours, so it was like posting the FP to your own GB, with the possibility of reaping BP and medals for your troubles.  But, you are deceived. This is a long game. Choose your GB wisely, and do indeed post FP to your own. Like a bank account, you will eventually get to the right number per building, and others who troll the 1.9 thread will quickly post their P1, P2 etc on your building, and as you grow, your investment will shrink per level.  By this time, because you play the game and accrue other Special Buildings and Event Buildings, you will have more FP coming in every day, and with access to GE and GBG, where the real action is, it will grow still more.  Listen to what Donna says, and what Angel says, and Ryudn and Rakush. It is absolutely in your interest to play how you’re comfortable, but eventually, and soon, EVERYONE eventually abandons the swap threads and goes for ONLY the 1.9 threads. You just gotta get over the swap hump.  But if you’re a newbie, read Rak’s initial post",

Rewards are pretty nice and the reward at the end based on guild standing is nice.  My other city got a 500 FPs per guild member reward for finishing in the top 30 guilds at the end of the last tournament (I believe there are 6 sessions per tournament).  \n\nPlaying is pretty easy.  Every 11 day session, starting on alternating Thursdays, is like starting a new Iron Age city from scratch.  My recommendation is build 6 lowest level houses, 4 Butchers, 3 amphitheaters, 1 ballista and 1 archery.  You need to use the Quantum expansions to build all of that.  You collect coins from houses and supplies from butchers every 10 hours, and you have to collect to start the next 10 hour cycle,\n\nFighting is easy on the guild map.  Move yourself to the current node.  If it is a battle one (most are) my fighting recommendation is to use mostly ballistas.  If there are any catapults or ballistas in the army you are facing, you should be able to auto fight with 8 ballistas.  When facing any horses, I replace a ballista with an archer for each horse I face.  I cannot successfully auto fight in those circumstances.  Rather, I target horses first then archers starting with archers near the top of the screen.  Only try to build more archers or ballistas when you don’t have enough to fight in this manner.\n\nIf you lack the attack strength to be successful battling as I describe, see if you can build a forgotten temple - it offers QI attack and defense boosts.  You can also look for attack boosts in your inventory that have the little fist - those help in QI.  They are timed, so use them when you can do a bunch of battles in a row.",

        "Article": "Negotiations",
        "Text": "[author:Written by Bethbird2020]\n\nNegotiating Goods in FOE is a combination of puzzle-solving (like the game Mastermind) with logic, a bit of pattern recognition through experience, and plain luck. Negotiations differ depending on location and encounter level meaning they are slightly different in GE, GBG and in the settlements where they are offered.\n\nThere are some basic strategies that might help you win more often and while spending fewer resources - here’s a few:\n\n— You can use your Tavern silver to buy 1 more turn for each negotiation in GE for a given period of time. This only works in GE and nowhere else.  Extra turns are not needed on the first few tries in GE since they can always be won in 3 rounds.\n\n— Mostly, this is a process of elimination. This fact is best used slightly differently in 3, 4, 5 and higher box negotiations.\n\n— Use the items that you are most willing to trade first. In the few challenges of GE try entering, for example, all coins if your supply is super abundant, then fill in the incorrect ones with supplies on the second try and finish any remaining boxes with goods on the 3rd.\n\n— Observe the outcome each time you click pay to negotiate. An “incorrect” means that item is out of the negotiation, disabling that good from being choosen for the rest of that encounter.\n\n— You can click to give up at any point and start over. In GE you will lose a turn but in GBG and settlements you can try over and over.  You will lose the goods that have already been negotiated but you might save others by avoiding a situation that can’t be won without a great deal of luck. For example, I always give up on a 5 place negotiation if the first try gives me back 4 incorrect and/or wrong person results.  I will have only 2 more tries to eliminate too many possibilities.  I might give up after a 2 second try if it looks like I’ll be unlikely to win on my last (but might keep going if I have an extra turn to use in GE).\n\nOften when you give up in a negotiation, the next one will somehow be easier to solve.  If not, you will eventually get one (if you can afford to keep it up).\n\n— Higher level/more difficult negotiations tend (stress tend) to want more goods and fewer supplies and coins.  Use this probability to increase your chances when you have to guess. When you get to level 4 of GE, negotiations will become very expensive, and even Medals will be brought to the negotiations menu of options\n\n— Should you use diamonds for negotiations?  That depends on how many you have and how you really need/want to use them elsewhere.  It might be reasonable to use one if you are sure you are only going to have the correct choice on the next turn or, if you have spent loads of scarce goods on a 7+ box negotiation and you be pretty sure you can pick the right one on the next turn. (Let’s not get into sunk costs here lol). Maybe you have just a few seconds until a boost expires and you need to finish or something like that might call for diamond use as well.\n\n— In GE the negotiations start to have more boxes and to cost more goods as you go further in, temporarily rolling back a little when you enter a new level. By the end of level 4 you will be spending 9 each of 9 boxes. This is where an extra turn comes in helpful, and likely diaonds. In GBG, you will be charged more goods per negotiation as attrition increases but the number of boxes will vary randomly.\n\n— Negotiations will gain you Castle points each day in addition to those for fighting. The big GE towers give you extra.",

Two of the adjacent sectors that we own (and we must own them for the SCs to help us) are C3Y, which has 1 SC, and C2S, which has 3. Combined, there is “4 SC support” total for the target sector.\n\nEach SC will reduce the percentage chance that your attrition will go up a point by 24%. This means 4 SC gives you a 96% chance that your attrition will *not* go up by 1 point after each fight. This means you can fight 100 fights, and statistically your Attrition will go up by only 4 points, total.\n\nConversely, if you fight in a sector with no SC support, your Attrition will go up 1 point after every fight, making it very hard to continue fighting until the Attrition counter resets at midnight",

The Traz is such a massive building, and so expensive, that you should instead use that real estate for more barracks, and focus your FPs on your Arc and Trinity, at the very least until they're all at level 10, if not 20. It is better to have fewer but STRONG troops, than more weaker troops. You'll get your Traz. Just get the big four in first.",

        "Text": "It is recommended that once you've built up your city enough so you're collecting more than 100 FP a day you should sync all your building collections to once a day. Use the crate on the left to collect all at once (a 5 FP charge, but worth it). Because the process of syncing everything up requires that you don’t collect on any buildings until they’re all bouncing and at a time of day you can reasonably be online consistently (ie, at 8:00 in the morning right after the Daily Quest renews, while you’re reading the paper in bed with your iPad, ahem), you leave yourself open to plundering on that one day, though it’s definitely worth the one-time risk. It also makes you want to replace all your 8-hr buildings with 24-hr buildings. This way you collect once a day, all at the same time, limiting your exposure to plundering, while also maximizing your FP on hand for investing in GBs.",

        "Text": "Tips for starting your Quantum Incursion city, starting at 8:00 AM server time every other Thursday.\n\n- four Tile Roof Houses - for population and coins\n- five Butchers - for supplies (or six, see below)\n- three Amphitheaters - for euphoria (happiness)\n\nSet up the Houses, three along the north east (top) wall and one along the right side of the town hall in an L configuration, leaving room for a road between the three and the one, connecting all four using five road tiles.\n\nSet the three Amphs along the outer eastern (right) edge, no roads required.\n\nFill in the west (left) and southern (bottom) open area with the Butchers. You can fit in five. Be crafty with your roads, using minimal number of squares. They are expensive.\n\nIf you have 100 triangular Shards to spare, you can buy an expansion with no rocks close to your Town Hall and drop in one more Butcher, for six total. This will not affect your Euphoria, and you will gain an extra 9,375 supplies for a total collection of 56,250 tonight.\n\nThis should provide 75 (or 50) extra people while still boosting productivity to 150%, which is important.\n\nLet this bake for ten hours, and tonight you’ll crank out:\n\n- 46,875 supplies\n- 37,500 coins\n\nCollect everything and let it simmer overnight to collect again in the morning. \n\nIf you added a sixth Butcher, you should now have enough supplies to swap an Amphitheater for an Arch, which provides much more Euphoria. Take out one Amphitheater and replace it with an Arch.\n\nKeep collecting and replacing/improving your buildings until you have room, people and coin/supplies to drop in fighters. Mik prefers Legionnaires. Pick your favorite and use 8 of them so you don’t need to plant two barracks.\n\nAfter another day, your city will be built up enough to pay for enough fighters to spend down your Quantum Actions, and keep pushing the frontier on the battle map. Keep checking in throughout your day to see if you have any play left.\n\nPlant every Neo building you win. They are excellent and give your main city a serious boost.",

        "Text": "How do the rewards in Quantum Incursions work?\n\nThere appears to be four different types of reward scenarios…\n\n- “Rankings” button chest for end of the Championship (3 months)\n- “Max” button with the chests you can buy at the end of each Incursion (2 weeks)\n- “Difficulty” button showing what you can win for helping finish each level\n- “Pass” button achievements for your own individual progress\n\n———\n\nThe end-of-Championship “Rankings” chest we get when the six-Incursions Championship ends. We will likely be in 14th place, which will get us decent rewards, including 1,000 FP. Each. Yes, you read that right. Plus a bunch of Neo building stuff, and 60,000 Quantum Medals, which can be traded in for main city expansions. Collect them all!\n\n———\n\nThe end-of-Incursion “Max” gets you two random FREE chests, and you can buy more. To buy all six Championship chests will cost 1500 Quantum Actions, which reward:\n\n- 200 Next Age Goods\n- 400 Current Age Goods\n- 800 Previous Age Goods\n- x fragments of Neo Colossus upgrade\n- x fragments of Neo Botanical Garden level 1\n- 400 Forge Points\n- 25,000 medals\n\n———\n\nThe end-of-level “Difficulty” rewards stack up each time we clear a level. With each cleared level we get more Neo building upgrades, with a chance at more upgrades somehow. All good stuff.\n\n———\n\nThe as-you-play “Pass” personal progress bar gives rewards in an eight item loop:\n\n- 150 Quantum Actions\n- 10,000 medals\n- 150 Quantum Actions\n- 10,000 medals\n- 150 Quantum Actions\n- Finish Special Production\n- 100 Quantum Actions\n- Neo Colossus upgrade\n\nThese can be increased by purchasing either the Silver or the Gold pass bar for cash dollars. The one purchase will stay with you for the whole Six-Incursion Championship (about three months).\n\nBottom line, Quantum Incursions generously hands out Neo buildings that rock, and Quantum Medals that you can buy main city expansions with. If everyone pitches in all season, we can crack Level VI and get CRAZY rewards. If we can obtain Top-10 status on the Guild Rankings, we EACH get 3,000 FP and a boat load of Neo buildings.\n\nParticipating in Quantum Incursions is good for both individual players, as well as the guild as a whole. Please do your part.",

Both Settlements and Quantum Incursions are in my opinion the biggest bang for buck in this game, except for everything else of course, lol\n\nLooking for any extra QI boosts you can? Check to see if you have any of those little Gong buildings from a recent event, one of them gives 3 blue and the other gives 3 red. They both also give % coin and supply boosts, too. Only for ten days, though. Good to use right when QI starts.\n\nGo to your Town Hall, scroll to the bottom of the Bonuses tab, and click the + for all QI boosts. See what pops up.",
